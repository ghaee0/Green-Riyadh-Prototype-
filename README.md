<h2>Description</h2>
<b>GreenThumb is a mobile app designed to support the Green Riyadh initiative, a large-scale project to increase greenery and plant trees across the city of Riyadh. The app aims to engage residents and encourage them to actively contribute to the greening of their city through volunteer planting activitie.
</b>
<br />
<br />
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<h4>1.	Increase Citizen Participation:</h4>
<a>Encourage Riyadh residents to actively participate in the Green Riyadh initiative by signing up for volunteer planting activities.</a>
<h4>2.	Facilitate Collaboration and Community Building:</h4>
<a> Enable seamless communication and coordination among volunteers through the in-app messaging and collaboration features.</a>
  
<br />
<br />
<h2>Target Audience </h2>
<h4>Riyadh Residents Aged between (16-60) years old </h4>
<h4> Environmental Enthusiasts</h4>
<br />
<br />
<h2>Key challenges </h2>
<h4>Choosing the color schema </h4>
<a>The color choices need to be made quickly and decisively to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing user experience, despite the limited time available.</a>
<h4>  Uncertain layout and screen design</h4>
<a>The layout and arrangement of the app's screens and features are still in the preliminary planning stages, creating uncertainty about the final user interface</a>

<h2>Research conducted</h2>
<h4>How Might We?</h4>
<a> A "how might we" is a question used to facilitate brainstorming. It prompts the group to consider future possibilities within an opportunity space. This approach can help teams begin to move from insights to ideas. The "How Might We" (HMW) format proved instrumental in shaping my approach to the GreenThumb app project. By framing key challenges as open-ended questions, I was able to explore a wider range of possibilities and generate more innovative solutions. </a>

<h2>Competitive audit </h2>
<a>competitive audit is an essential part of competitive intelligence. It involves a complete assessment of your competition through notes of their products, branding, content, features, and benefits. It also includes several other factors, such as: Strengths and weaknesses. Unique features. Conducting a competitive audit played a crucial role in the development of the GreenThumb app. By benchmarking against similar apps, I was able to identify opportunities to differentiate the app and develop more innovative solutions.</a>

<h2>What have I used in each step?</h2>
<p>The design strategy leveraged various design thinking methodologies to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience. The process began with a <strong>competitive audit</strong> where I conducted a <strong>comprehensive analysis</strong> of existing volunteering and plant care apps to identify industry trends, best practices, and potential areas of differentiation. <strong>This competitive research informed the next step, where I engaged in "How Might We"</strong> to deeply understand the target users' pain points, needs, and motivations. Through <strong>user interviews</strong> I was able to uncover rich insights. then moved into the <strong>ideation phase, generating wireframes</strong> To bring these ideas to life, I developed high-fidelity prototypes. <strong>Metrics such as time on task, error rate, and success rate</strong> were carefully tracked to validate the design decisions and ensure the app's functionality aligned with user expectations.</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>The wireframe establishes the app's information architecture and interaction flows to guide the development of high-fidelity mockups.</p>
