<h4>  Uncertain layout and screen design</h4>
<a>The layout and arrangement of the app's screens and features are still in the preliminary planning stages, creating uncertainty about the final user interface</a>

<h2>Research conducted</h2>
<h4>How Might We?</h4>
<a> A "how might we" is a question used to facilitate brainstorming. It prompts the group to consider future possibilities within an opportunity space. This approach can help teams begin to move from insights to ideas. The "How Might We" (HMW) format proved instrumental in shaping my approach to the GreenThumb app project. By framing key challenges as open-ended questions, I was able to explore a wider range of possibilities and generate more innovative solutions. </a>

<h2>Competitive audit </h2>
<a>competitive audit is an essential part of competitive intelligence. It involves a complete assessment of your competition through notes of their products, branding, content, features, and benefits. It also includes several other factors, such as: Strengths and weaknesses. Unique features. Conducting a competitive audit played a crucial role in the development of the GreenThumb app. By benchmarking against similar apps, I was able to identify opportunities to differentiate the app and develop more innovative solutions.</a>
